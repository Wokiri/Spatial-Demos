                    <p>
                        That you may appreciate my uncoerced dedication to this profession, my love for it and the manifold joys it bring;
                        <br>and that you may see my prowess, professionalism in handling your business, commitment to serve you,
                        and that I submit impressive, functional web apps-- the exact kind you needed (if not better),
                        are the two ends I'm striving to meet in this inspirational writeup.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So scroll down through to the end. I want to show you why I code, and why I'm the guy whose invaluable resources
                        (mental and otherwise) you might want to engage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was born sometime in the decade that ushered in the current century, somewhere in the highlands of Kissi county, Kenya.
                        I would grow up under the care of both parents who worked so hard to cater for many of the family's domestic needs.
                        In that endeavor, I must say they did relatively well: in my boyhood, I watched wrestling in a colored TV, or played
                        mobile games, or DVD games at home. These things brought a deep sense of satisfaction in a young boy's life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I then enjoyed the unique possibilities that technology offered. I was moved by these innovations, I admired them
                        and the whole phylosophy behind their creation-- to make life a little easier and sweeter, reasonated largely with
                        my idea of 'good life.' I wanted good life. I desperately craved for more beyond the little that would be traced within
                        our humble abode.
                    </p>

                    <p>And so it was that my love for technology was cultured.</p>

                    <p>
                        Today the story remains unchanged. It interests me that mankind at a time that constitutes the present finds his life
                        revolving around some (if not all) aspects of this great technological dynamic. The various forms in which
                        technology has revolutionized within just over two decades is a many sided reality that speaks of nothing but
                        exponential growth.<br> Life has been made 'better' by the developement of uncountable useful applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Advancement of the web infrastructure for instance has brought significant alterations to the way the world is run.
                        The internet has becomes man's central medium of communication.
                        It is his conduit to social relations, his means of study, research and education, a successful
                        tool of trade, a potential facilitator of entertainment, just to mention but a few. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    </p>



                    <p>
                        It is my purpose to advance the possibilities that the web has to offer.
                        There's not a shadow of doubt in my mind that the present era of ICT is here for yet a long time. <br>
                        Neither do I question the idea that this ... is at an altogether high moment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These are possibilities which I think should be exploited further and improved for the better by all means.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If there's one thing I'm looking forward to is making something of my life. I want to build myself in every reasonable way
                        that there is.
