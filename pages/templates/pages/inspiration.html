    Whatever they are, I know my reasons for coding lie heavily on the fact that I relate
    with this century's concept of Information Communication and Technology-- ICT, also commonly
    termed Computer Science-- CS (whether rightfully so or not isn't in my place to settle).
</p>

<p>
    It interests me that mankind in this time finds his life revolving around some (if not all)
    aspects of this great technological dynamic. The internet has becomes man's medium of communication.
    It is his conduit to social relations, his means of study, research and education, a successful
    tool of trade, a potential facilitator of something, just to mention but a few. <br>
    Of course we dare not forget the significant contribution this technology made during the Covid-19
    pandemic era. It benefited a great many people with the uncommon chance of tele-conferencing for the
    first time. <br>
    Yet these things were unheard of in the days of 'chon manene', days when my grandmother was a
    a little girl.

<p>That is why I am in this business!</p>

    But then there's more. Granted, ICT or CS comes with all these awe-striking priviledges, but it
    then also bring a sense of vulnerability in one way or another:

    <li class="list-group-item">Issues of security...</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Issues of security...</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Issues of security...</li>
</ul>

<p>
    It is my purpose to advance the infinite number of possibilities that the web has to offer. <br>
    There's not a shadow of doubt in my mind that the present era of ICT is here for yet another long time. <br>
    Neither do I question the idea that this ... is at an altogether high moment.

<p>With this conviction comes...</p>

<p>Perhaps you now want to discuss a project with me. Lets get over to that, shall we?</p>
